f	"Growing up bilingual, I always had in intereset in languages. Over the years, this interest grew and I not only learned more languages, but I also started learning about linguistics. 
Linguistics is fascinating to me as it is such a diverse field of research. Adding computation to this field gives endless possibilities of research, but also the possibility to build useful and meaningful tools, such as for detection of hate speech, tutoring systems, systems for mdecial workers, and so on.
Because everybody uses language in their day to day life, computational linguistics is a field that can touch and support an incredible amount of enterprises, projects and people."
m	"I was always interested in learning languages, but also in logical thinking 
and math. Computational Linguistics is the perfect program to combine both of those passions of mine. 
In the linguistic field I find it fascinating to learn how the brain processes language and how people learn a second language 
differently from how they learn their native language. 
I also really like the way that language is explained in a logical way. 
On the computational side, AI is a very important and interesting topic for the future and 
it has a lot to do with Computational linguistics, since we are the ones that teach the AI how to understand, 
process and speak a new language. 
There are many more other interesting subjects in the field so there is something new to learn and discover every day. 
I am convinced, that I chose the right subject with a promising future."
f	I've been interested in language for as long as I can remember. At school, I liked learning the grammar of foreign languages. When I discovered that there was a whole science dedicated to studying language from an abstract perspective, I knew that I wanted to study linguistics at university. But I also loved math, so I pursued a double-major bachelor degree in both subjects. Afterwards, I decided to enter the ISCL MA program at Tübingen University. What I like about computational linguistics is that it includes a wide variety of approaches and topics, both very application-oriented and very theoretical ones. My interest is primarily in using computational techniques to aid theoretical linguistics, especially historical linguistics.
m	"The biggest reason I took this course of study (not this  class specifically, but ISCL in general) was because I wanted to live in Germany.
The second biggest consideration for me was marketability; I already have a German degree (and was going for a degree in Biology in America 
before I ran out of money), but at this point I'm concerned primarily with the ability to get a well paying job, and my ability to obtain a work
visa in Germany. This class in particular seems to be extremely useful for making me competitive in the job market. I figured, with my 
background (and interest) in studying German, computational linguistics specifically seemed to be the most natural next step. Many of my 
friends back home in the USA have jobs in tech and, in their mid 20s, earn more than my parents, so it seemed logical to do the same as they 
did and put my layman's interest in computers and technology to use professionally."
m	"I first studied linguistics during my first Bachelor's degree in Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL).
After graduating I taught English in Japan at public schools. After some time I realised that teaching was not the
career I wanted to continue pursuing, but I was still fascinated by linguistics. After much consideration I decided to
incorporate my hobby, computers, with my interest in linguistics. That eventually led me to this program. I couldn't be
happier!"
f	I have decided to study Computational Linguistics because I have always liked logic and learning languages. Even though I was sceptical about the computational part of those studies before I enrolled, I turned out to really like programming because it has such a logical structure. I also enjoy the linguistic part of my studies, although I often get annoyed about linguists not agreeing with each other and everyone having their own theory. But maybe one day I will develop my own theory as well and then others can get annoyed about it as well. I hope that my studies in Computational Linguistics continue to be interesting and successful. Sadly, I need one more sentence because the test for this file requires MORE THAN five sentences, even though in the instructions it says AT LEAST five sentences.
m	"My main interest is to continue using code and getting experience with it. 
How code gives one the tools to build something is fascinating.
I do a part time job with web code but that's closed due to CoronaVirus.
The linguistic stuff like information retrieval is cool, though
many of the specific details in linguistic fields I don't care much about.
Right now I'm most annoyed that my computer is stuck on running python 2.7
even though it says it's running 3.6 in the 'select interpreter'.
I'll have to figure this bug out later with visual studio code."
f	"There are multiple reasons why I am interested in linguistics and computation.
I believe that one of the most important aspects of human intelligence consists of their ability to understand and generate natural language.
Therefore automatic processing of natural language is crucial for progress in technology and artificial intelligence.
It is really fascinating that machines can understand and even generate natural language and even improve themselves automatically.
Also I am interested in algorithms and languages in general and I think that combining those topics makes much sense."
f	"#your interest in linguistics and computation in at least 5 and at most 15 sentences.

Recently I grow a great interest in NLP, because I find it very practical. A product can have a more accurate algorithm, when the technology in NLP is upgraded, thus satisfying the customers. To realize it, I want to know the characteristics of natural language and computation. Currently I am focusing on computation. So this course is perfect for me. I hope through this course I can gain a deeper understanding of NLP and computation."
f	I am very interested in major computational linguistic fields such as speech recognition and machine translation. My favourite linguistic area is pragmatics. In my opinion it is a crucial and yet often ignored aspect in voice recognition and implementing chatbots. Therefore more work can be done in order to improve them. Another thing I would love to do something about is implementing cognitive processes underlying human speech (which can surely improve the quality of human to machine interaction).
f	Human interaction can have many different forms. The usage of natural language is only one of them, although to me it seems to be the most sophisticated way. A main advantage of humans compared to apes is their ability to communicate efficiently. Intrestingly, there are several thousand different languages which have evolved that serve that same purpose. Understanding how language works opens new perspectives.
m	"I like the idea of improving the relationship between computers and regular language through the study of Computational Linguistics, which can be achieved by creating software products that have some knowledge of human language.
Such products are going to change our lives, they are urgently needed for improving human-machine interaction since the main obstacle in the interaction between human and computer is a communication problem.
Such computer programs will also make a broad set of interesting natural language applications possible: spoken information systems, machine translation systems, natural language interfaces, and many others.
Studying Computational Linguistics enables me to have a better understanding of how both human and machine languages works and how to be able to make that connection between them.
Another motivation to study computational linguistics is the theoretical part of it, since it focuses on the computation of the relation between form and meaning for its own sake. This computation has interesting formal properties and relates in interesting ways to theoretical aspects of the theory of computing in general."
m	"I am a ISCL, BA student. My interest in linguistics is Phonetics and Phonology as well as Syntax, Semantics
and Pragmatics and Language and Cognition. Also, my interest in Computational is Natural Language Processing and Underestanding,
Speech Recognition and Processing. I am also very interested in using new approchaces like, deep learning, Neural Networks and
Machine Learning to do the NLP and Speech recognition. Furthormore, I have passion to learn how can I use these AI algorithms to
interact with machines like Smart phones, Game box (like Xbox), Cars and so on."
f	My interest in linguistics became apparent during my school days where I enjoyed the language subjects the most. I took every language offered at my school and had good grades. It was clear to me that I want to learn more about languages, so I decided to enroll in a Bachelor's program for General Linguistics. It was not until the last year of my Bachelor's studies that I heard about Computational Linguistics when I wrote a term paper about Machine Translation. I read more about the topic and discovered that it is a very interesting field. Even though I had not much to do with computers up to that point, I knew that this is what I want to do. So, I started to teach myself some programming and the basics of Computational Linguistics in order to be able to apply for a Master's program in Tübingen. I am very happy that I got admitted! I discover new approaches and topics each week and it amazes me what can be done in linguistics with computational models, machine learning and the likes.
m	"I am studying computer science and my favorite part of this study program is the
development of compilers and therefore also programming languages. If one is
concerned with studying and designing programming languages, it will become
quite obvious that language shapes thought in the most interesting ways. That is
why I also care much about natural languages and also how to formalize, analyze
and compute them."
m	At high school I took some language classes, and for a long time linguistics was talked about, and something I was very curious about. I also did a lot of maths at high school, and had an interest in computer science. The combination of both linguistics and programming in one degree looked like a great opportunity. I enjoy the logic that can be applied to many aspects of linguistics. I additionally feel a great sense of satisfaction when I successfully solve a problem. I particularly like the fact that there are often multiple ways of approaching the same problem and that all of them can successfully solve the task at hand.
f	Prior to 2016, when I commenced the BA in Computational Linguistics I did not have any interest in either Linguistics or Computation. A friend of mine was begining the ISCL degree in the winter and asked me to come with her. I said I had no interest in the degree however after some persuasion and as my job was very boring I said I would try it for a semester. I didn't really have any expectations of the course, nor did I have a clue what computational linguistics even meant, however I finsihed the 1st semester, then the second and third. I can now say that I definately have an interest in both the computational and linguistic side. I am very interested in machine translation (statistical and rule based). I find the programming side of things difficult and frustrating, but also very satisfying and somewhat enjoyable.
m	﻿I'm interested in different parts of linguistics and computation. Combining different parts of linguistics, like syntax and phonology of a language, with computation, such as parsers, is a very interesting field of Computational linguistics. In my opinion, Machine Learning systems are one of the main point of our future. A machine being able to learn from own mistakes and improve the overall system is a very helpful tool that we already use on a day to day basis. One of the main points of Machine Learning, are neural-networks, which I believe are the future of how we use our technology and software. Combining Machine Learning with real languages and analyzing those is in my opinion one of the most interesting topics in Computational Linguistics.
f	"I interested in N-gram and pos tagging. 
I already did in Java class, but i want to know how different way i can do with python.
And i specially interested statistical parsing. 
I learned statistic and parsing last semester, but both were more theory part. 
so i wonder what and how i can statistical parsing in NLP."
f	My interest in languages and computer goes back to 2011, when I presented a Bachelor's thesis on the localization of food labels in order to fulfill my Bachelor's program in Translation (EN-PT) from the University of Brasilia (Brazil). For the purposed of my research, I got acquainted with the technological process involved in translating websites, apps, and softwares, which sparkled my interest in exploring the relationship between language and technology. As a result, I started a MA at the abovementioned University to explore localization development in Brazil by measuring the activity in platforms like Twitter - whereby I ultimately came across Computational Linguistic studies. Therefore, I’m interested in the impact caused by the growing development of tech gadgets aligned with language.
m	Sound always fascinates me. It surrounds us in our whole life, yet for most of us we can't see it. In the form of languages, it carries information and emotion among us. In the form of music, it covers the boredom in the air. These frequencies of vibration somehow shaped who we are. With a background of music and engineering, I came here to further delve into the computational world. I wish to crack the hidden secret of sound, music and speech, creating innovative technologies to bring new insights to ourselves. There is one more thing. I speak a rather ancient language that can be traced back to about 2000 years ago. But it is dying, being murdered politically. I want to shelter it via technology and spread it through the net. So when the last word meets its end, the seed of the language   could rise again.
f	As a Computer Science major, I am interested in all applications of Computer Science, including Computational Linguistics. I think there are very interesting Computational Linguistics applications out there, like translation services or virtual assistants, and I hope to find out more about the mechanisms behind them. Furthermore, I feel like I was able to cover most foundational topics of Computer Science in my studies so far, expect for Natural Language Processing, about which I am very happy to get the chance to do so now. Additionally, I have learned foreign languages since kindergarten and have been living abroad in several countries, which has fostered my interest in languages. Thus, I feel like Computational Linguistics is the perfect field for me to combine my interest in Computer Science and in languages.
f	"I'm interested in linguistics, or the science of languages, because I believe language is what makes human human. 
And now with the assistance of computers, we can analyze a large amount of data that human alone couldn't.
Moreover, the combination between linguistics and computation refines linguistics. Because when I study linguistics, regardless of phonology, syntax, or semantics, I often feel like linguists kind of made up the theories to fix with the data and their assumption about how lanagues work. And it makes me a bit skeptical.
But computers work on rules and rules only; so we would know which theories work and which not.
My interests at present are about sentence/text comprehension and production, and applications of CL into education, and a bit about psycholinguistics (i.e. how languages make us human)."
f	"Language is our main means of expressing ourselves. It helps to communicate, to express cultural identity in the sense of nationality but also in a more arty way. I have always been fascinated by that and how language / a dialect can change rapidly even from one village to the next. To ""teach"" a computer language in a world which is hardly imaginable without computers anymore, is a really interesting task. And in some sense, learning a programming language is like learning a new language to me."
f	"Learning languages has always been a hobby of mine. Learning to speak and understand other languages gives me a sense of accomplishment and changed how I view the world. When I learned that some machines/programs can understand and use natural languages, I wanted to learn how that is even possible. That's why I choose to study Computational Linguistics. Out of the major fields of Linguistics, Semantics and Pragmatics interest me the most. Since I had a lot of fun learning the meaning of language and figuring out how its meaning may change in different context. Machine learning is what makes ""intelligent"" machines/programs possible. To understand how it works, I have to know the statistical models behind it."
